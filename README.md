Predict number of students on private and public school in Hawaii

In this project, I want to determined the best time series model to predict number of students. For both data, I perform similar analysis such as:
1. Stasionary Test & Differencing: I difference the data until it is stationary.
2. Construct Possible Model
3. Choose model with lowest AIC & BIC
4. Seasonal Model Check
5. Residual Check: independent Test, normality Test, residual is white noise or not, model variance < data variance.
6. Overfitting Check
7. Cross Validation
8. Forecasting
